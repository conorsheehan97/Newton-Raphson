# Newton-Raphson
This project implements the Newton-Raphson method for root finding using OOP, and verify that the root chosen exists by plotting the function analysed using Python's matplotlib library. 

In this project, we declare a Newton Raphson class, with methods for Setting an initial guess, tolerance, Newton Raphson implementation, max number of iterations, and a dervitive check, to ensure that our current derivitive value is not near-zero, else our method will spiral off away from our root. We implement this Root Finding Class on Sin(x) - 0.5, checking our found root against the plot of the function generated using Pythons Matplotlib module. 

A PDF generated usign Latex is also included, giving a brief description of the method both matematically and algorithmically.
